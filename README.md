## Hi everyone, 👋
# 💫 About Me:
🎯 I’m currently working as per intern at genaikit software solution private limited. I’m building AI-powered applications using LangChain, FastAPI, and vector databases. I’m mainly focused on improving chatbot performance, RAG pipelines, and integrating LLM features into real-world products.
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on<br><br>I’d love to work with others on generative AI projects—especially anything related to AI chatbots, document analysis, voice-enabled tools, or automation using LLMs.
🙌 I’m exploring ways to optimize large-scale RAG systems and improve deployment strategies for AI apps. Any guidance around scaling FastAPI backends or improving inference efficiency would be awesome.
🌱 I’m diving deeper into vector databases, AI agents, and improving my knowledge of LangChain, FastAPI, and cloud-based deployment. I’m also sharpening my frontend integration skills with React.js.
💬 LLMs, RAG, AI chatbots, FastAPI, or building end-to-end AI applications—from data retrieval to frontend integration. I enjoy discussing real-world use cases and practical implementation tips.
⚡I love experimenting with new AI ideas—half the time it starts as a small script and ends up becoming a full project. 😄
